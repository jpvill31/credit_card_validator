# credit_card_validator
Validates credit card numbers using Luhn's algorithm in order to see if credit card number is from a real creditor or not. First the string is converted to an integer list, then the check digit is retrieved from the list (a digit removed from the end of the credit card number, then later reinserted to the card number for verification purposes). Next, each number at an even index of the list is doubled, in accordance with Luhn's algorithm, and later subtracted by nine if the doubled number is over nine. The check number is then reinserted at the end of the list, and the check_sum conditional is used to determine if the card is divisible by 10 or not. If it is, then the card is a real credit card number from a real bank, if it is not then it is a fake credit card number.
